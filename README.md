============

This repository contains a compendium of data (/data), source code (/src) and figures (/fig) reproduced from the publication: L.S.Premo, 2004, Local spatial autocorrelation statistics quantify multi-scale patterns in distributional data: an example from the Maya Lowlands, Journal of Archaeological Science 31, 855-866 (DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2003.12.002).

> Site coordinates have been included in this report in hopes that interested researchers will take this opportunity to experiment with the local spatial autocorrelation analysis. (Premo, 2004, p.858)

The aim of the present project is to study spatial autocorrelation statistics and experiment with the local spatial autocorrelation, reproducing the results of the original research.

> Despite the fact that local spatial statistics display a unique potential to investigate location-based hypotheses, few tools exist for applying them to archaeological data. Fortunately, Sawada[15] has provided a Visual Basic for Applications add-in for Excel, called Rookcase [...]. (Premo, 2004, p.858)

The present project makes exclusive use of R to reproduce the original research.
